\usage{
pico_p2p(cluster = "chat", name = p2p_name(), ...)

availablePicoP2PWorkers()
}
\arguments{
\item{cluster}{The p2p cluster to connect to.}

\item{name}{The name of the client as publicized on the P2P cluster.}

\item{\ldots}{Not used.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{PicoP2PFuture}.

\code{availablePicoP2PWorkers()} returns the number of registered workers on the P2P cluster.
It will always return at least one worker, which is yourself.
\emph{WARNING: This is currently hardcoded to 10 workers, regardless of the number.}
}
\description{
\emph{WARNING: This function must never be called.
It may only be used with \code{\link[future:plan]{future::plan()}}}
}
\details{
A pico_p2p future is an asynchronous multiprocess
future that will be evaluated in a background R session.

The Pico P2P future backend relies on Pico to
distribute futures among a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of R workers.
Users with a Pico account can join the P2P network by
being invited to a shared folder.

Users who wish to share contribute the compute power of their
computer should call \code{\link[=pico_p2p]{pico_p2p()}}.

Users who wish to take advantage of the compute power of the
P2P network should use \code{plan(pico_p2p)}.
